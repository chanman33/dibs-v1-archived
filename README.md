Dibs-v1-archived (high fidelity wire frame - archived after pivot)

We don't want to be a property listing marketplace that offered loans. We want to be a lending company with a marketplace of agents. 

Archived, but keeping it around to reference any useful components or code.

Deployed on Vercel: https://dibs-v1.vercel.app/

Based on the FindHouse - Real Estate Next.js template as the foundational codebase.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
